Firstly, the following PHP code will allow me to connect to the database named ‘Project’ from the localhost server. 
The data for each parameter is assigned first to variables, and then these variables are passed when instantiating the 
new MySQL connection to the database.

$servername << 'localhost'
$username << 'root'
$password << ''
$dbname << 'Project'
$conn << new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname)

The statement ‘SHOW TABLES’ returns the table names from the database connected. This will be used to retrieve the 
list of months available, as each table contains one month of data and is named correspondingly. The ‘query’ method 
takes the SQL statement as it’s parameter and queries the database, returning the result.

$sql << "SHOW TABLES"
$result << $conn->query($sql)

The ‘SELECT DISTINCT’ statement returns only the different values from the specified field. Therefore, this can be 
used to get all of the different crime types for the user to select, which would be better than hardcoding the crime 
types in as different data used may not have the same crime type values. The following SQL statement will be used 
which selects all the distinct values in the ‘Crime type’ field from the table ‘2011-01’.

"SELECT DISTINCT `Crime type` FROM `2011-01`;"

The following two statements should finally get all the data records from the database table for the specified month, 
which is stored as the ‘fromDate’ variable. The date is concatenated to the rest of the SQL query string using a 
period (.). Separating the data into two variables for crime location and the information should help keep better 
organisation of the code as the data is separated for it’s different purposes. 

"SELECT Latitude, Longitude FROM `" . $fromDate . "`;"

"SELECT `Crime ID`, `Reported by`, `Falls within`, `Location`, `LSOA code`, `LSOA name`, `Crime type`, 
`Last outcome category`, `Context` FROM `" . $fromDate . "`;"

Even though these will return all records, a ‘WHERE’ clause can be concatenated to the end to extract only those 
records that fulfil a specified condition.

“WHERE `Crime type` = ‘Robbery’;”
